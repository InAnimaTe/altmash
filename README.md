## AltMash - The terminal based coin data analyzer

> As I'll probably never get the time to actually build this, I figure I should at least link another awesome project called [coinmon](https://github.com/bichenkk/coinmon). It does a lot of what I meant for altmash and has some exciting upcoming features. Additionally, check out https://github.com/cmahon/awesome-cryptocurrency and https://github.com/kennethreitz/awesome-coins for more awesome crypto related stuff!

AltMash helps you understand the current market and how your present/future
investments may fare. AltMash does this utilizing the API for the given exchange
and actually having the intelligence to do some quick and simple calculations
for you. This helps you more easily predict and understand your options.

Project goals (for the moment):

* Display current prices and other small amounts of data on health of currencies
    * Something like the 24hr high/low.
* Allow to calculate the rate of return based on a given increase/decrease from
  the current market value.
* Possibly show time based chart/graphs of a certain period.
* Show the percentage change for the time period.
* Show the volume for the time period.
